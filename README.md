# Show video date

To keep user from being distracted by factual information on their site, some content providers decided to remove the creation date of a video. Google followed... though on google it's easy to click on a link a type "v" in place of "reels" to see a video in normal view, with a date.

Thankfully, the horrific, web breaking Next is so badly created, it's possible to find a lot of unintended left over data.

This script will add a box with creation date next to a video.  

Temporarily, there are few more dates I found and add to the box. I don't know what they are.

If this install link does nothing, you probably don't have *Monkey manager. Get it here:

[Tampermonkey extension for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)  
Additional step on Chrome: right-click the TamperMonkey icon on browser toolbar > Manage > "Allow user script"

[Tampermonkey extension for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)


Now click first link again.
